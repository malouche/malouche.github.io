abstract = {Background/Objective(s)
Multiple sclerosis (MS) patients are exposed to various psychosocial factors, such as depression, anxiety, fatigue and pain, which can negatively affect their quality of sleep and their participation in physical activity.
Material(s) and Method(s)
A path analysis using a Bayesian Network learning algorithm was employed to analyze MS dataset which included data collected from 100 MS patients. Analysis was performed without prioritizing a specific target variable. This approach helps determine whether pain impacts sleep or physical activity, or if sleep quality influences physical activity levels.
Result(s)
The analysis revealed significant relationships among the variables. Higher anxiety levels were associated with increased physical activity, suggesting a bidirectional influence. Both anxiety and pain interaction significantly contributed to pain severity, highlighting a complex interplay between psychological factors and pain experiences. Additionally, both anxiety and depression influenced sleep quality, highlighting the importance of mental health in sleep patterns. Furthermore, factors such as the years since diagnosis, physical endurance, depression, and sleep quality influenced pain interference, providing insights into the interplay between physical and psychological factors in pain experience.
Conclusion(s)
The findings reveal complex and interrelated dynamics between physical activity, pain, and sleep quality, significantly influenced by psychological factors such as anxiety and depression. Understanding these relationships is crucial for developing effective interventions for MS patients.},
