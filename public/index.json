In the first chapter, I will give examples of time series and how we can manage time series data using R. The next three chapters are more theoretical. I will present the notions of stationary processes, linear filtering, ARMA processes, and linear predictions. In the second part of the course, I will introduce non-stationary processes such as ARIMA and SARIMA processes. I will provide methods for estimating models with real data, with an emphasis on efficient model selection procedures and forecasting. The final third of the class will be devoted to other techniques for times series analysis such as exponential smoothing based methods.\nThroughout the class, I will make use of several types of real world data. All of the examples given will be shown how to be performed at the same time in R.\nProgram overview  Introduction to Time Series: First examples, definitions of trends, seasonality and noise, Stationary processes, definition and examples.

Tunisia reacted early to COVID-19, resulting in a low number of infections during the first wave of the pandemic. This study was performed to model the effects of different interventions on the evolution of cases and to compare these with the Tunisian experience.  A stochastic transmission model was used to quantify the reduction in number of cases of COVID-19 with the interventions of contact tracing, compliance with isolation, and a general lockdown.  In the model, increasing contact tracing from 20% to 80% after the first 100 cases reduced the cumulative number of infections (CNI) by 52% in 1 month. Similarly, increased compliance with isolation from 20% to 80% after the first 100 cases reduced the CNI by 45%. These reductions were smaller if the interventions were implemented after 1000 cases. A general lockdown reduced the CNI by 97% after the first 100 cases. Tunisia implemented its general lockdown after 75 cases were confirmed, which reduced the cumulative number of infected cases by 86% among the general population.  This study shows that the early application of critical interventions contributes significantly to reducing infections and the evolution of COVID-19 in a country. Tunisia's early success with the control of COVID-19 is explained by its quick response.","tags":null,"title":"Impact of contact tracing, respect of isolation, and lockdown in reducing the number of cases infected with COVID-19.

They are specified through pairwise relationships between variables. Under suitable conditions, they can be used to read conditional independence relations at the level of sets of variables. It‚Äôs known that faithfulness property is filled when the graph allows identifying the whole set condition independence statements. This paper studies the implications of imposing the faithfulness assumption on either the covariance or concentration graphs. We demonstrate that if a probability distribution is faithful to its concentration graph. The corresponding covariance graph is a union of complete connected components, i.e., each connected component cannot have any marginal independence among its nodes. We also prove a dual result when the distribution is faithful to its covariance graph. The general implications of the results are far-reaching. First, the result formalizes the long-held notion in the graphical models‚Äô community that faithfulness is a very restrictive assumption. Second, we show that estimation procedures in graphical models by low-order conditioning may lead to erroneous conclusions. Since these procedures effectively search for models in a very restrictive class of probability. distributions.","tags":null,"title":"Implications of Faithfulness in Graphical Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dhafer Malouche","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.
