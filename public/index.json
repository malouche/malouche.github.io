An R package named SensMap is made available to facilitate the adoption of the EPM technique in different research fields and to propose, in addition to classical features, advanced strategies for map visualization and its stability enhancement. The novelty of SensMap is to provide options in sensory space dimension reduction methods as well as options in consumers' likings prediction models based on sensory descriptors. The fitting quality of these models can be evaluated using several information criteria. Moreover, SensMap provides a methodology to quantify and assess the stability of preference maps from different employed strategies using a computational algorithm that consists in calculations of distances between maps based on resampling approach. A small part in this paper was devoted to evaluate the efficiency of the implemented stability approach by a simulation study and by application to real data from food science field. To make easier the conduction of the multiple types of analysis without requiring high programming knowledge, a very intuitive Graphical User Interface named SensMapGUI is implemented on the SensMap package. It is an R-developed shiny web-tool that produces results and graphics quickly and efficiently. The tool is made available at the following address [](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SensMap/index.html) and is dedicated for all sensory practitioners and can be widely used by researchers who need subjective to objective data mapping.","tags":null,"title":"SensMap R package and SensMapGUI shiny web application for sensory and consumer data mapping, Variations on external preference

this paper, we aim to estimate the excess of mortality associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2,COVID-19) pandemic. For this analysis,  we merged population data and deaths number provided by the World Bank database and the projections of COVID-19 deaths of 151 countries published by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) of the University of Washington in Seattle. These projections are computed using a deterministic SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered) according to the effects of non-pharmaceutical interventions. We had predicted on December 31, 2020 for 151 countries, and according to each scenario, the new death crude rate (DCR) associated with COVID-19, its growth rate, the share of this cause of deaths in the yearly total number of deaths, and in the daily number of deaths on December 31, 2020. Excess of mortality (vs baseline growth of DCR) is varying markedly across countries. Regardless of the Scenario, Peru would be the country with the highest increase in its DCR. It would grow of 24 percent. Many European countries, like Belgium, Italy, United Kingdom would also know a significant increase in their DCR.

Tunisia reacted early to COVID-19, resulting in a low number of infections during the first wave of the pandemic. This study was performed to model the effects of different interventions on the evolution of cases and to compare these with the Tunisian experience.  A stochastic transmission model was used to quantify the reduction in number of cases of COVID-19 with the interventions of contact tracing, compliance with isolation, and a general lockdown.  In the model, increasing contact tracing from 20% to 80% after the first 100 cases reduced the cumulative number of infections (CNI) by 52% in 1 month. Similarly, increased compliance with isolation from 20% to 80% after the first 100 cases reduced the CNI by 45%. These reductions were smaller if the interventions were implemented after 1000 cases. A general lockdown reduced the CNI by 97% after the first 100 cases. Tunisia implemented its general lockdown after 75 cases were confirmed, which reduced the cumulative number of infected cases by 86% among the general population.  This study shows that the early application of critical interventions contributes significantly to reducing infections and the evolution of COVID-19 in a country. Tunisia's early success with the control of COVID-19 is explained by its quick response.","tags":null,"title":"Impact of contact tracing, respect of isolation, and lockdown in reducing the number of cases infected with COVID-19.

They are specified through pairwise relationships between variables. Under suitable conditions, they can be used to read conditional independence relations at the level of sets of variables. It‚Äôs known that faithfulness property is filled when the graph allows identifying the whole set condition independence statements. This paper studies the implications of imposing the faithfulness assumption on either the covariance or concentration graphs. We demonstrate that if a probability distribution is faithful to its concentration graph. The corresponding covariance graph is a union of complete connected components, i.e., each connected component cannot have any marginal independence among its nodes. We also prove a dual result when the distribution is faithful to its covariance graph. The general implications of the results are far-reaching. First, the result formalizes the long-held notion in the graphical models‚Äô community that faithfulness is a very restrictive assumption. Second, we show that estimation procedures in graphical models by low-order conditioning may lead to erroneous conclusions. Since these procedures effectively search for models in a very restrictive class of probability. distributions.","tags":null,"title":"Implications of Faithfulness in Graphical Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"b5e9660321607bec1cc8b6eb4d24d127","permalink":"https://dhafermalouche.net/project/credisdash/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/credisdash/","section":"project","summary":"Les cr√©dits vot√©s  par  les d√©put√©s tunisiens   de Novembre 2012 √† Mars 2019.","tags":["credits"],"title":"Cr√©dits Vot√©s","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590969600,"objectID":"46aff4691306d2023bee0da129170034","permalink":"https://dhafermalouche.net/project/durationcoviddeaths/","publishdate":"2020-06-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/durationcoviddeaths/","section":"project","summary":"Every 43 seconds someone dies by the COVID-19 in the World, Statistics until June 1st, 2020","tags":["covid"],"title":"Every 43 seconds someone dies by the COVID-19 in the World","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1589932800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589932800,"objectID":"f4398d6ae07c5a7faee4e8e0b991b97a","permalink":"https://dhafermalouche.net/project/euvsuscovid/","publishdate":"2020-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/euvsuscovid/","section":"project","summary":"This a Tableau Dashboard displaying the results of the Municipal Election held in Tunisia in 2018.","tags":["covuseu"],"title":"COVID-19 US vs EU (5/20/2020)","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588464000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588464000,"objectID":"b8ae265d0647f03988ebf7667c8d7db9","permalink":"https://dhafermalouche.net/project/bedscovid/","publishdate":"2020-05-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/bedscovid/","section":"project","summary":"Number of beds vs COVID-19 cases, May 3rd, 2020","tags":["bedscovid"],"title":"Number of beds vs COVID-19 cases","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585958400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585958400,"objectID":"a38a91244b0689e29fb5a0884c055774","permalink":"https://dhafermalouche.net/project/tuniscovid/","publishdate":"2020-04-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/tuniscovid/","section":"project","summary":"COVID-19 Tunisian situation until April 4th, 2020.","tags":["tuniscovid"],"title":"COVID-19 in Tunisia, 4/4/2020","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1584921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584921600,"objectID":"0aed09317cc921085f00530df99b5998","permalink":"https://dhafermalouche.net/post/thousandcases/","publishdate":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/thousandcases/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["COVID-19","coronavirus"],"title":"Number of days to reach more than 1000 COVID-19 confirmed cases","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Les graphiques sont bas√©s sur des donn√©es collect√©es √† partir du site de de l‚Äôorganisation Al Bawsala .
