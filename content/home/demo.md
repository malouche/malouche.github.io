Welcome to my website! Here, I'll be sharing my recent course materials, research papers, projects, and talks with you. As a Professor of Statistics with a Ph.D. in Statistics and Applied Mathematics, my expertise spans over two decades. I'm enthusiastic about utilizing R, Python, H2O, and Spark to solve Machine Learning, Statistical Modeling, and Data Visualization problems. Your feedback and questions are always appreciated, so don't hesitate to reach out. Let's explore the world of data analysis together!
