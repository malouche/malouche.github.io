Want to know how get data from a [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) table into your R script?  Look no further.  

I was recently attempting to scrape a table from Wikipedia.  I was responding to a group chat and wanted to make a quick histogram (something I love about R and ggplot).  In my search, I came across this very helpful tweet from [Julia Silge](https://twitter.com/juliasilge):

```{r echo=FALSE}
blogdown::shortcode('tweet', '951639629182074880')
```

This is great piece of quick code to scrape the data from the table.  However this tweet is specific only to the example, and I want to generalize the code for any Wikipedia table.

I'm going to show you to scrape data from any Wikipedia table using Firefox browser and R (of course), although I'm sure this could be adapted to other browsers.  

I'll show how to change the above code into a code to scrape the table I was interested in, which was the [attendance size of Trump's rallies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rallies_for_the_2016_Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign).  Here, I'd like to scrape the `Primary rallies (June 2015â€“June 2016) ` table.

The first thing to change is the `read_html()` line:

```{}
read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_members_of_the_United_States_House_of_Representatives")
```


all we need to here is update the hyperlink by copying the web address of the wikipedia page:

```{}
read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rallies_for_the_2016_Donald_Trump_presidential_campaign")
```

The next thing to change is the `html_node()` line.  For this this you'll have to know the tag of the table in the html code.  To find this you'll have to [inspect the html code](https://www.lifewire.com/get-inspect-element-tool-for-browser-756549) of the wikipedia page you're looking at.

Inspect the table you're interested in and you'll see a line starting `<table class= ...`

![Screen capture of inspector, highlighting line <table class= ...](wikitable_example.png)

Right click on that line and select `Copy` -> `XPath`

then update the with `html_node` line, using the `xpath` flag:

```{}
html_node(xpath = '/html/body/div[3]/div[3]/div[4]/div/table[2]')
```
