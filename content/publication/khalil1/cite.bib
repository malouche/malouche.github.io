abstract = {Background/Objective(s)
People with MS (PwMS) have a significant occurrence of falls; this high occurrence is due to the physical and cognitive impairment associated with the disease progression. Falls may result in severe injuries which significantly affects the quality of life for (PwMS). Although many mobility outcome measures have been suggested as fall risk indicators, their validity has not been extensively validated.
Material(s) and Method(s)
A retrospective cross-sectional study included 97 PwMS with mean (SD) of age of 35.97 (11.04) years. Outcome measures included BBS, SPPB, 10MWT, 6MWT, 5xSTS. Fall history in the past 12 months was recorded. People were classified accordingly into faller (2 or more falls in the past 12 months), or non-fallers (one fall or no falls reported in the past 12 months). The data analysis utilized many approaches, such as an exhaustive search algorithm, a genetic algorithm, and a backward stepwise selection procedure. We employed the exhaustive search technique to evaluate every possible combination of predictors, ensuring the selection of the model with the lowest Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). To evaluate the predictive performance of the logistic regression models, we calculated Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the Area Under the Curve (AUC) for each model. The AUC was calculated to quantify the overall accuracy of each model, with higher AUC values indicating models with lower error rates and better predictive capabilities.
Result(s)
Logistic regression with adjustment for age and sex indicated that BBS total score, SPPB total score and 6MWT significantly predicted the fall status group (P <0.05). In a model where the interaction between predictors was examined, significant interactions were observed between 6MWT and SPPB, as well as between SPPB and BBS. These interactions suggest that the combined effects of these mobility measures play a crucial role in predicting fall risk. Additionally, the interaction between age and gender, as well as age and 5xSTS, further highlights the complexity of factors influencing fall risk in PwMS. The inclusion of these interaction terms significantly enhances the model's fit, as indicated by a lower AIC and higher pseudo R-squared value, reflecting improved predictive accuracy and reliability. This model also showed the highest discriminative ability with an AUC of 0.87, reflecting excellent performance.
Conclusion(s)
Based on predictive validity, the BBS and the SPPB and 6MWT were the best outcome measures in this study showing statistical differences in differentiating between fallers and non-fallers in PwMS.The model that examined the interaction among predictors was the most effective in prediction with the highest discriminative ability; this suggests that the combined effect of these mobility outcomes (i.e. BBS, SPPB and 6MWT) would provide the best choice for predicting the risk of falls in this population.}
