abstract:  This paper investigates the capability of undirected graphs (UGs) to represent a set of Conditional Independence (CI) statements derived from a given probability distribution of a random vector. While it is established that certain axioms can govern this set, providing sufficient conditions for UGs to capture specific CI statements, our focus is on covariance and concentration graphs. These remain the only known families of UGs capable of describing CI statements. We explore the issue of complete representation of CI statements through their corresponding covariance and concentration graphs. Two parameters are defined, one each from the covariance and concentration graphs, to determine the limitations concerning the cardinality of the conditioning subset that the graph can represent. We establish a relationship between these parameters and the cardinality of the separators in each graph, providing a straightforward computational method to evaluate them. In conclusion, we enhance the aforementioned procedure and introduce criteria to ascertain, without additional computations, whether the graphs can fully represent a given set of CI statements. We demonstrate that either the concentration or the covariance graph forms a cycle, and when considered in conjunction, they can represent the entire relation. These criteria also enable us, in specific cases, to deduce the covariance graph from the concentration graph and vice versa.
