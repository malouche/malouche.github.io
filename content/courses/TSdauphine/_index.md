## Description

This course is composed of three parts. In the first chapter, I will give examples of time series and how we can manage time series data using R. The next three chapters are more theoretical. I will present the notions of stationary processes, linear filtering,  ARMA processes, and linear predictions. In the second part of the course, I will introduce non-stationary processes such as ARIMA and SARIMA processes. I will provide methods for estimating models with real data, with an emphasis on efficient model selection procedures and forecasting. The final third of the class will be devoted to other techniques for times series analysis such as exponential smoothing based methods.

Throughout the class, I will make use of several types of real world data. All of the examples given will be shown how to be performed at the same time in R.
