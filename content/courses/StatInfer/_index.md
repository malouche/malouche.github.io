## Description

This course provides a theoretical foundation for statistical inference. The three main goals in inference (estimation, confidence set construction and hypothesis testing) are discussed in decision theoretic framework. Many illustrative examples and practical applications will be discussed.


## Program overview

- Basic   distribution theory of order statistics 
- Sampling   distributions and the central limit theorem 
- Properties   of point estimators (relative efficiency, consistency, sufficiency) 
- The   Rao-Blackwell Theorem and minimum variance unbiased estimation 
- Confidence   intervals
- Methods   of estimation (the method of moments, the method of maximum likelihood)                                   - Hypothesis   testing (Elements of a statistical test, calculating, Types I and II error   probabilities, testing of hypotheses concerning mean(s), variance(s) and   proportion(s) 
- Uniformly   most powerful and generalized likelihood ratio tests
